            "|US         |43335941   |R3KPC0NBUDASX3|B00R8KC02Q|872035750     |Thule EnRoute Triumph 2 Daypack                  |Outdoors        |5          |25           |25         |Y   |N                |Love the Thule backpacks. Great pricing & features compared to competition. But make sure you get the right one            |THULE:<br /><br />Ok, Thule is a company that really cares about outdoor enthusiasts, understands real-life needs, and listens to feedback. That's demonstrated in their products.<br /><br />All Thule packs are well-constructed, durable, light weight, and very smart designs. All of their current bags feature the &#34;SafeZone&#34; pocket (a hard shell protection), with plenty of room for sunglasses & phone. And, all of their bags seem to have dedicated electronics pockets. But not all packs are equal...this one is really for outdoor excursions, not the ideal choice for school or urban use.<br /><br />This model (EnRoute Triumph 2 Daypack) is a very smart pack - under 2 pounds, has multiple pockets and storage nooks, high quality zippers and snaps, handy security pocket, and more. It provides 1,282 cubic inches of storage.<br /><br />OUTDOOR PACK:<br /><br />You should know up front this is an outdoor pack - a daypack for hiking (solo, or with the family), for trips to the beach, for skiing/snowboarding, mountain biking, light camping, things like that. For example, it *barely* fits a standard sized 15.6&#34; laptop - ok for occasional use, but I wouldn't want to haul around a laptop every day in this pack, the corners could get bumped.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, this is a versatile pack, you can use it for anything you want. But if you're looking for an urban/city pack, or a school backpack, there are better options. Read on...<br /><br />OTHER STYLES:<br /><br />For work or urban use - try the Paramount Daypacks. They are more designed for electronics, books & paperwork, etc. Plenty of room for your laptop, extra padded compartment.<br /><br />For high school or college - I would recommend a Thule Crossover Daypack (versatile - use as a school pack, and also for a weekend or overnight bag). Or the Thule Paramout Daypack.<br /><br />Finally, the Subterra Daypack is an interesting option to check out for urban, work, school, that can dub as a weekend bag. It's extremely versatile with lots of amenities and plenty of padded compartments for electronics.<br /><br />AMENITIES:<br /><br />The EnRoute Triumph 2 has a nicely padded back, with air channels, to keep your back cool. And the shoulder straps are well-designed, they don't dig.<br /><br />The Enroute Triumph 2 has got a chest strap but no belt strap (for small packs I prefer a simple belt strap, for a little extra support, and so the backpack doesn't flop around. But companies seem to be getting away from that, especially on smaller packs like this).<br /><br />Unfortunately you have to choose between hydration pack and laptop - there's only 1 slot. But outdoor daypacks aren't really designed for laptops - there's plenty of room in here for hydration pack + tablet + phone, with lots of room left over.<br /><br />If you want to skip the hydration pack, there are 2 side pockets for water bottles (or other things). It also features an outer easy-access flap, your SafeZone hard pocket, a security pocket (perfect for wallet & keys), lots of loops and clips for compass, sunglasses, or even strapping on a bedroll or yoga mat. The main compartment has 2 small pockets, a medium pocket, a large pocket, and a clip.<br /><br />SIZE & FIT:<br /><br />1282 cubic inches is a good size for a daypack. I have a generic &#34;oversized&#34; backpack I use at the gym (11x14x7), which &#34;appears&#34; much bigger, because it's got one large compartment. But it's actually about 15% smaller (1078 cubic inches vs 1282). It's all in how you use it, and taking advantage of the pockets and pouches in the Thule.<br /><br />This entry-level Thule EnRoute Triumph 2 is plenty of room for a variety of outings, encourages minimalist planning, and keeps it light. I've found with some smart packing, it will fit the entire contents of my 2-child diaper bag, and is plenty for our beach essentials or a day hike with the kids.<br /><br />The fit is great, too. Adjustable and very versatile - it fits me (an oversized 6 ft frame), my wife, *and* my 5 yr old daughter. It has lots of adjustments, contours the back, and feels fairly weightless when wearing it. It is rare for a daypack to fit a large person comfortably (I've got a wide frame and big shoulders). But it fits fine. As I said, Thule put a lot of attention into fit, comfort, and quality.<br /><br />OTHER OUTDOOR PACKS:<br /><br />My favorite outdoor Thule daypack is the Thule EnRoute Escourt 2 Daypack - just a few dollars more, has hip belt, and about 25% larger. I love hip belts on daypacks.<br /><br />However, the Escourt may be too big for many people (such as a mom on the go). I suspect most people would fine the EnRoute Blur 2 Daypack a perfect fit, with just a bit more space & versatility than the EnRoute Triumph 2.<br /><br />PRICE:<br /><br />Thule currently offers 14 options for daypacks, with prices ranging from $59 to $149 (everything in their product line is under $150...the Departer 23L has an MSRP of $59 but it's currently on Amazon for $54.50 with free shipping). Those are great price points for technical packs. I was snooping yesterday at the local Northface, REI, and Eddie Bauer stores ...and most of those daypacks ranged from $129-$229, for comparable quality and features. So Thule is definitely offering competitive prices.<br /><br />Even at Target, I saw a very basic JanSport backpack going for $45 in a back-to-school event. If you're going to spend that kind of money on something that will barely last a year, do yourself a favor - invest an extra $10 or $20 on a nice Thule (which is going to last longer, fit better, and have better storage to make your life easier).<br /><br />If you're not sure what you're looking for, the Thule web site has a pack-finder tool that's easier than sifting through search results on Amazon. Go find the packs that suit your needs, then come back to Amazon for the best deal.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE:<br /><br />Great outdoor pack. This is one of the smaller, entry-level packs for Thule, but still has loads of features. If you're looking for a school, work, or urban pack, this might not be the pack for you - check out the options I mentioned, or the Thule web site, then come back to Amazon for the best price.ersized 6 ft frame), my wife, *and* my 5 yr old daughter.

Very warm with thick padding. I got hot in it fast. Of course this wasn't outside in 30 degree weather.<br />-The blue color is nice.<br />-An added little quilt inside that can be taken out if it gets too hot and used as a lap blanket. It's not big, but it will help if it's really cold.<br />-The hood is pretty neat. It will keep your head warm and has a little bonus pillow built inside.<br />-Soft interior. No scratchy material. I despise scratchy fabric.<br />-Can be zipped up to another sleeping bag to make a giant sleeping bag. I'm not sure if this interchangeable with other bags of different brands, but it probably is, but I'm too lazy to pull out one of other sleeping bags to try it.<br />-The hood is zippered on if you really want to take it off.<br />-Plenty of room. I guess it's about the same size as most sleeping bags. I'm 5'0 and under 120 lbs, so it's obviously really big for me.<br />-Unzips to lay flat and spread out like a blanket. All sleeping bags actually do this, but why not throw it in there.<br />-Really well done casing that's connected. Makes it a snap to roll up, use the snaps and shove back in the bag. (see pics)<br /><br />What I don't like:<br />-It is heavy, 6.6 pounds. But I suppose if you want to stay warm in freezing weather, lugging a 6 pound sleeping bag is going to pay off over a lighter 3 pound sleeping bag.<br /><br />Overall, this is a great bag. There really isn't much I can find fault with. Just be aware, you want to take it on a hiking trip, better account for the<br />weight.<br /><br />*How To Get It Back In The Bag<br />1) Fold in half, lengthwise.<br />2) Roll tightly from the foot end.<br />3) Use your knee as you roll to compress and continue rolling to the top.<br />4) It might be a little wonky once you get to the hood, but just roll until you get to the attached black sleeve.<br />5) The bag naturally rolls into the sleeve, just use a knee to keep it compressed if you need to, and snap the buckles together.<br />6) Tighten the straps attached to the buckles and shove into the bag. It will be a bit tight, but it wasn't that hard to get the bag inside, and I'm a tiny  woman.he bag naturally rolls into the sleeve, just use a knee to keep it compressed if you need to, and snap the buckles together.<br />6) Tighten the straps attached to the buckles and shove into the bag.

It can keep you much warmer in the winter, much drier in the rain and do more to help you sleep than just about any other item in your pack. When the weather is cold, heat transfer from your body to the ground can be deadly. A sleeping pad like the OZone puts an inch or more of insulation between you and the ground. When there is rain or excessive condensation the pad keeps you sleeping bag out of the water. When the ground is hard and rocks the pad can provide an awesome cusion.<br /><br />Below and in the video I do a quick comparison to several other sleeping pads. In general, inflatable pads are more comfortable and provide better protection. They also tend to compress down well and weight less. Unfortunately they can also be compressed by an elbow and hip or punctured by a sharp object. Foam pads are more reliable but in general are more bulky, heavy and less comfortable. The OZone sort of straddles the two by providing a minimalist layer of inflatable comfort wit ha nice attached pillow.<br /><br />The OZone seems best suited to weekend backpacking or longer backpacks where rain or below 40 degree weather is rare. Considering the fact that this pad rolls up to the size of a 1L bottle, includes a nice pillow and weights so little... it's pretty amazing. I sleep on my stomach most of the time and I noticed that it is very comfortable on my back and stomach and less so on my sides where I could occasionally feel the ground. Overall this is an excellent pad for many applications, especially the ultralight backpackers.<br /><br />[RATING 1-10, 10 is BEST]<br /> Comfort = 7<br /> Thermal Protection = 6<br /> Rain Protection

The uber-warm factor comes from its unique approach of using duck down near the shell and polyester on the inside. (Label states it is 25%duck down and 75% polyester fill.) It is cushy and as my girlfriend stated, like sleeping on a cloud. This model is 6 ft long, plenty long for me and my partner. It is zippable from either the top or bottom and has a mummy style hood that tightens up snugly. According to the label, it's water repellant. I have yet to test that out.<br /><br />There is a certain amount of trade off in getting a bag this luxuriant. Although the label also claims that it is very compressible, it's in a different category from say, my Mountain Hardwear backpacking bag, which compresses so small it can fit in a little pocket at the bottom of my pack. Even compressed, I would have to strap this puppy onto the outside of my pack. No biggie-the label claims it stuffs down to 10.5x18 inches and I can live with that. The 6 ft model I have for review weighs in at 4 pounds 1 oz,, so although it's light by car camping standards, it can't compete with my 2.5 pound bag. Nor should it: it is a whole different animal. And then again, my Mountain Hardwear bag is rated down to a mere 35 degrees.<br /><br />It's interesting that Kelty gives a different temperature rating for men and women. Apparently, women sleep colder than men, and Kelty gives separate ratings for both men and women. While this bag is rated down to 6 degrees for men, it is rated 19 degrees for women, so keep that in mind when shopping.<br /><br />All in all, this is a deluxe bag, extremely comfortable and ideally suited for car camping, but could definitely be used for short backpacking trips where weight isn't critical. It's simply one of the most comfortable bags I've ever had the pleasure of slipping into. Highly recommended.

While I haven't had the chance to challenge the lower temperature limits of the bags, I have slept in them and I find them both equally comfortable.  This morning outside with the temps in the 60's and I in my flannel pajama's, I zipped the Tuck all the way up to see how sweltering hot I'd get.  I was a little too warm.  Of course, if it got down to the 20's, I'd have more than just pajamas on.  No way would I undo the bottom to untuck my feet.  That may be a selling point, but I'd untuck my arms before I'd ever consider untucking my feet.  For whatever animal insticts I possess, I always feel less secure with my feet exposed.<br /><br />Between the Kelty Cosmic and the Kelsy Tuck, which one do I prefer?  The Kelsy Tuck.  While the Cosmic sports more substantial baffles along the zipper and neck, the Tuck can be zipped up from the outside and inside of the bag.  The Cosmic can only be zipped from the outside.  Also, the Tuck has a pouch conveniently located inside the bag for mp3 players or other small electronic device, another feature lacking in the Cosmic.<br /><br />Like the Cosmic, cinching the cords around the hood and neck area is easier done before zipping up the bags.  I've had bags that cinch from the inside and can be done with the bags closed, so it is something Kelty needs to work on.  Other than that, this bag is a winner.<br /><br />___________________________________________________________________________________<br /><br

Having just returned two sleeping bags for various reasons, this was like a light at the end of a tunnel!<br /><br />My prior issues with sleeping bags have mainly been:  improper temperature ratings (cold to sleep in even though the weather is in their supposed comfort range), horrific zippers that make it impossible to zip yourself up, large size (weight and/or compressibility of the bag).<br /><br />Suffice it to say, this bag swats away the competition I've dealt with so far.  For a bag rated, temperature-wise, relatively this low, it is very small and easily fits into any straps on a 40-60L bag I'm aware of.  It's feather light, no pun in tended.  I meant this thing is really, truly very light and does wonders for those hiking for days on end like myself.  Finally, the zipper is seamless.  Nothing gets stuck, it's easy to maneuver from inside the bag too.  The bag is also very comfortable to sleep in.<br /><br />Kudos to the company for making serious note of temperature differences between men and women.  Women do tend to sleep colder than men as I have found out on more than one occasion.  This bag is thus rated a comfort 32F for women and 21F for men.<br /><br />I have already tested it in 30F weather with two layers of dry clothing, no wind, in a one man tent, with no additional liner, and slept very warmly.<br /><br />Easy to roll back up into the sac when you're done too.  Brownie points for that as many bags are not so easily fit back in.<br /><br />Overall, this is a superb sleeping bag and I highly recommend it.

This will be my first synthetic filled bag by them. My other three are down bags, down is super light weight which is good for backpacking and very insulating when dry. All my bags are still in good condition and almost like the day I bought them and we camp often and for weeks at a time sometimes. We have some older synthetic bags by various companies and mainly just keep them around when friends want to borrow and don't own their own gear. After buying my first Kelty Cosmic Down 20degree bag in 2012 that's all I want to sleep in. I then bought their Cosmic down 0 degree bag and it became my favorite even in summer as you can sleep with it unzipped and use like a blanket or  sleep on top it's cozy fluff. Then I just purchased a Cosmic DriDown 32 degree bag recently, as it has water phobic down and will work better in moist conditions. I am still getting use to that bag as I prefer the old school colors that are bright and allow me to see if a creepy crawly is on my bag easy. Otherwise they have similar builds, all four are mummy bags and I am 5'6&#34; and 130lbs. For me they are cozy yet I can turn over completely in them and move my legs enough not to feel squeezed. All four have the soft silky feeling of polyester.<br />This new Tuck bag almost feels like it's full of down but is listed as 100% polyester fill. I can not yet say if it will be good down to the stated 22degrees as we currently don't have that type of weather but I do like some of the new features including the Zipper running down then across your foot area to allow your feet to breath, this feature also allows you to get up early in the cold and move around without getting out of your bag and losing your warmth, you can slip on sandals and make your oatmeal and tea without leaving the warmth of your sack. I would love to get my hands on a down bag with that feature. All four bags do zip up and down from both ends but my older three just have the zipper run down the side and stops at the foot box.<br />I also love that Kelty has the rating of their bags printed right by the top of the zipper, the older models even have in monogrammed in. They all pack down to similar size and a compression sack would make them even smaller. The sacks have ratings on them also and a nice little pocket on the base to hold onto making them easy to get out of their sacks. When you put them back in the sacks you don't roll them, you literally stuff them in, it works great. They all have draft tube along zipper and across chest to keep cold air out. Mummy hood is adjustable to close around your head with a pull string to where you can just have you nose sticking out for air if you want. This Tuck bag is a men's bag rated 22degrees which women sleep cooler most the time so it's a 32degree bag for a woman. 31&#34; x 78&#34; 28 oz fill polyester. I rate this a four at this time, I like the new foot Tuck feature but I love my down so until I have a few nights under colder conditions I will have to wait to pass judgement on warmth. At 3lbs it's not far off for weight to take back packing and it's priced under down so you could save. I got most my bags off season and the price dips if you keep an eye out especially for older models. I know my cosmic bags look different than the current ones offered under same name and temp rating. I have included two photographs to show the foot Tuck feature on the blue bag which is the bag this review is for. Also a photograph of all four bags together, the Orange is the 0 degree bag the green is 20 degree and both of these are from 2012 and still look great, see how much puffer they are. The purple bag with the Orange interior is the newer Dridown 32 degree bag.e the zipper run down the side and stops at the foot box.<br />I also love that Kelty has the rating of their bags printed right by the top of the zipper, the older models even have in monogrammed in.

It's light weight enough to split between backpacks and each person only has to carry a few pounds. Two people will fit inside but it's tight room for sleeping pads and small travel air mattresses. Foot end is 3'10&#34; head end 4'2&#34;. Large vestibule to keep your gear under and out of the elements. This is my first Kelty tent but I own half dozen tents, different tents for different circumstances. I do own a few of their sleeping bags which I love.  This tent has some things I really like that are new to me, the guy ties have a cool easy to use tension bracket. The rain fly has a small look out window to see what's going on outside your tent when it's closed. The rain fly also folds back for star gazing or if you just want more air. This feature is easy to do by folding back half the rain fly and using attached clips to hold in place. I included a photograph of this pulled back and clipped. The doors are like D doors yet the base continues to unzip almost the full length of the tent making it easy to enter and exit or put a blown up mattress inside with ease. The tent itself is mostly netting except the floor, always a lot of air flow. It does not come with a foot print, I would suggest getting the one made for this tent or just make one yourself out of tarp or plastic, it will save the flooring from moisture, dirt and stones. The one thing I am hesitant about are the poles, they are nice light weight poles yet the are specialty curved and have clear plastic attachment point that I worry about if either would break on trail, you can't use a pole from a different tent or if that plastic knob breaks, there goes that attachment point. Not huge deal but something to think about. I do like the small knobby ends that attach poles to tent base, they are color coded green for head end of tent, bottom of poles are green for that side. They go to the green webbing. Just be sure to get that clear plastic hub facing down, tricky at first but easier after you know how it should look. I will include a photograph of that hub. I like the clips that hold the rolled up rain fly and doors open. While it will stand without pegging it down it is wobbly on its own, needs staking for proper usage. Comes with small light weight tent stakes. Inside you can sit up fully and there are small pockets for keys or wallet near head area. Taped seams, small covered vents above each door in rain fly. Over all a nice tent for backpacking or bug free sleeping.lastic hub facing down, tricky at first but easier after you know how it should look. I will include a photograph of that hub.

It was a pain to install (took at least an hour, maybe 2), but it is completely secure and stable mounted on a rack over the rear tire and our kid enjoys it just fine.<br /><br />The Thule Ride along mounts under the handlebars on the front of the bike. So when you turn the handlebars, the baby seat turns as well. Very exciting for the kids, they will love the front view and action packed twisty turn ride. However, no matter how much we tighten it on the bar, it swivels. The swivel adds a certain instability to the handling, though I would not say it is a major issue.<br /><br />My other gripe is how it affects the adult's ride. If you have any length to your legs whatsoever, you will have to splay your knees out as you peddle. Otherwise, your knees will bump it as you ride. Also, we are not able to stand/straddle the bikes between the seats and this baby carrier.<br /><br />We have two schwinn hybrid bikes (the network and the discover) and we keep the seats mounted as far back as they go and high enough to get full extension peddling. We have to lean the bike to the side (which you can't do with a baby on board) or hop off when we come to a stop. Normally, we would slide forward of the seat at a stop and then hop back on as we go again. Can't do it with the Thule on either of our bikes. If we kept our seats at the hight they should be, we would have to dismount to the side when we stop. We ended up lowering the seats so we could stay mounted at a stop.<br /><br />It is awkward at best and dangerous at worst.

As hitch racks go this thing looks really sleek and nice on the car.  The curves texture is a nice touch and accents the car nicely.<br /><br />I am putting this on a 2014 Ford Escape (with tow package).  I used the 2&#34; receiver and I really like on this rack that they screw the 2&#34; adapter on the unit (I am surprised a rack of this size would even offer the 1.25&#34; hitch support) this allows the adapter part not to move around like some other racks I have used.<br /><br />The unit is very well made and feels really solid (plus it is pretty heavy).  It came with everything I needed which was nice (including a nice strap to hook the bikes/tires together).<br /><br />Putting the thing together was pretty easy, but be sure to read the instructions since there are these two small screws you put in (not sure why they do not do it) that you need to put in.  The rubber bands that hook around the bike are easy to put on and seem to hold the bikes in place properly.  There were also some additional items for keeping the frame from moving which I only put on occasionally depending on wha I am carrying (mainly road bikes).  I tried this with my Mountain bike and road bike (took some photos in my garage) and found (like most racks) I like to leave a space between them and the mountain bike's different profile makes the tire collide with the handlebars of my road bike and I do not want my handlebars getting dirty from the MTB's wheels.  I think if both bikes were the same type they would probably be fine putting them closer together changing direction for each one.<br /><br />With the two bikes on the rack it was solid and the one side screw mount on the hitch made it not wobble.  The only hitch lock I have currently goes through and would cause it to wobble, I might get a new hitch lock or just run a cable lock through the hitch chain hole (truthfully no matter what you do, if someone wanted to steal them they can get them off the car; so I just do not leave it in bad locations).<br /><br />I really like the lift handle for titling down the arms and the bottom one for tilting down the entire rack.  It was easy to use and much more elegant than push pins.<br /><br />The straps made the bikes feel secure on it and the includes strap was nice for tying through wheels to keep them from moving.  The pull out lock that connected to the end arm for securing everything was a nice touch!  The slitted bike rest section on the arms also allowed for my road bike who had the cable along the bottom partly to easily go in without the cable rubbing on the frame.<br /><br />My favorite thing is that I am able to tilt it down and still open my liftgate which was not possible in some of my older racks (they were fine when I had a car, but the SUV was a problem).  I will add a note for those with foot activated liftgates; put the keys away from you when putting on the hitch, I frequently forget and when working around the hitch it sometimes thinks you are activating the liftgate and it starts opening!<br /><br />In the end I am very happy with this and highly recommend it!  It looks great on the car and works amazingly!  The built in lock and easy leaning mechanisms make this easy to use!!!

Great rear door mounted bike carrier. High build quality. Secures well, with no rubs (when installed properly)|From an owner and user of a hitch-mounted Thule 956 Parkway rack. So, I feel somewhat informed to offer an opinion after attaching and using The 3-Bike version of the Thule Raceway (model 9002Pro).<br /><br />Attaching the rack was easy. The user manual is great, with very useful illustrations. Should take you no more than 10 minutes the first time, and half that from then on. Removal is even easier.<br /><br />The rubber pads give just enough to really secure your bikes. Thule makes a point of their 'Patented No-Sway Cage' and I found it to perform as advertised. On bumpy roads, over speed bumps, and down the interstate... made no difference. The rack is heavy, in a build-quality sense. I will update my review as I have more trips using the rack. IMHO, you should use a hitch-mounted rack... if your vehicle supports it.<br /><br />I see the negative reviews are more about the rack not fitting specific vehicles. I can't add much for or against that criticism but the rack fit very well on both a 2012 Audi A6 passenger car and a 2011 Buick Enclave SUV.

Thule (pronounced TOO-luh) tests and engineers its products rigorously so they know how much bouncing and shaking they can take. They don't recommend you drive off-road with your bikes in this hitch rack, but I did a little of that, and everything held up fine. The first time I put 2 bikes in this rack, I watched in the rear view mirror very closely, and when going over speed bumps, I saw a lot of bouncing, but mostly the bikes stayed perfectly still, safe and secure ... BUT then when I got home, I noticed that I had neglected to connect the strap that stabilizes the seat pole of the rear bike. Once properly strapped in, the bikes are always secure. You can drive across country and not have to worry about them.<br /><br />Cons: Just two, and neither is the fault of the product -- with the rack and bikes in place, the rear sonar sensor alarm in my SUV goes crazy whenever I shift into reverse because it thinks I'm about to back over a bicyclist. And the second con is that, with the rack installed on my large SUV, it won't quite fit into my garage ... the door can't close because the rack sticks out too far. So I have to remove the rack every time I park in the garage. Fortunately, the rack is fairly easy to remove, just one socket wrench to remove one bolt. The rack is listed at 42 pounds but I find it pretty easy to slide out and move to its spot in the garage. The whole removal process takes only a minute or two.<br /><br />Pros: It comes with key locks for the bolt in the trailer hitch and also the arm of the rack, and it has a cable that enables you to lock the bikes so you don't have to worry about theft when you're parked and the bikes are left unattended. I suppose someone could use channel locks and cut the cable to steal your bikes, but at least they do provide some theft deterrence.The rubber straps that secure the bikes on the rack are surprisingly easy to attach and detach. It looked like it would be a struggle to stretch those small strap holes over the pegs, but if you just pull firmly, it's pretty easy. The rack keeps the bikes plenty high enough off the ground that you don't ever have to worry about hitting bottom.<br /><br />If you didn't have to remove the rack every time you park in your garage, you probably could leave it on all the time, because the bike arms fold down and, with the lift of a latch, you can fold the rack out of the way of your rear hatch for loading the back (my liftgate opens straight up, not side to side). Since I remove the rack after every time I use it, I don't know if that rear sonar sensor alarm would go crazy with just the rack mounted and no bikes on it, but if it did, I would always remove the rack anyway just so I don't have to hear the screech alarm every time I shift into reverse.<br /><br />My only question is whether the rubber straps that are vital to securing the bikes will stand the test of time. With years of stretching and weathering, I expect they could snap, crack or tear. But it's probably an easily replaceable item.<br /><br />UPDATE 8-9-15: My SUV has an on-off switch for the rear sonar (didn't know about that when I wrote the review), so with the flip of a switch, I don't have to listen to that squeal whenever the bike rack is mounted. Also, I drove through 6 western states, mountains and deserts, over 2 weeks with 4 bikes in the rack, worked like a champ.oles over the pegs, but if you just pull firmly, it's pretty easy.

It actually swings over to the side of your vehicle (not just tilt down) so you can fully access the back of your vehicle.  I love this feature when I use this rack on my truck.  I can get to the bed of the truck so easily now because the rack is truly out of the way.  If you are a camper or prefer to leave the rack on your vehicle, this will be especially convenient & worth the extra money.  You may need to think about your parking spot if you plan to swing it over; you may need a little more room on that side of the vehicle.<br /><br />-This is a big steel rack & weighs about 42 pounds.  It has a built-in handle so you can carry it/put it on/off easily.  We take ours on/off each time we use it - it's really fast & easy.  A wrench is provided to tighten the bolt on to your hitch - we just keep it in our glove box , ready to go.  It is rock solid attached to the hitch. We took it fully loaded on some rough road & there were no problems.  Took it fully loaded on the interstate for about 200 miles with no problems.<br />-Hitch-Mounted Rack - You need a 2&#34; receiver to use this (1.25&#34; will NOT work). You can buy a 1.25&#34; to 2&#34; receiver adaptor if you need to but make sure to take in to account that the tongue weight capacity of your hitch will probably be reduced - maybe by 50%.  Add up the weight of the rack & bikes.  And know what &#34;class&#34; your hitch is rated for & its weight limit, etc.<br />-It has a hinged arm that swings over to the side of your vehicle (even fully loaded with bikes!) so you can completely access the back of your vehicle.  No climbing or reaching over the top of your bikes like with a tilt-down rack.<br />-Using the swing-arm feature is very simple:  Just pull a spring-loaded pin, turn the hand knob to loosen & swing the rack to the side.  Genius!<br />-The 2 arms of the rack have an arch & are longer than most racks allowing more room for different size bikes.  With the extra room, the chance of pedals & handlebars banging each other is greatly reduced.  We loaded this with 4 adult mountain bikes with no problems.  The first time you do this, you may need to adjust your cradles a bit but you will soon have a system to do it quickly.<br />-The arms have a quick-release lever to easily lower them out of the way if you are not hauling bikes.<br />-The cradles are excellent at holding bikes steady even when going down a rough road.<br />-The cradles are &#34;no-sway&#34; which keeps the bikes steady.<br />-The cradles have grooves in them to accommodate brakes cables, etc. so they are not pinched.<br />-The cradles can be removed completely or moved along the arms to adjust for different bikes.<br />-A buckle strap is included.  You fish this thru all the wheels & gently tighten.  This provides an extra level of protection for the wheels so they don't bang against each other.<br />-The rack has a built-in cable lock that pulls out of the rack & goes over the bike frames to lock them on to the rack.  It has a key.  It is 30.5&#34; long.<br />-A hitch lock does NOT come with the rack but is sold separately.  The hitch lock, locks your rack to your hitch/vehicle.<br />-Rack Arms are each 25&#34; in length.<br />-Rack can hold up to 140 LBS of bike.<br /><br />-Make sure you have enough clearance on your vehicle for this rack (bumper, spare tire, etc.).  Bottom of the rack:  From the center of hitch pin hole to the knob at the bottom of the rack, the measurement is about 8.5&#34;.<br />-Higher part of the rack/upright bar:  Center of hitch pin hole to the upright bar is about 14&#34;.  So a spare tire would need to protrude less than 14&#34; depending on where it hangs relative to the upright bar.<br />-From hitch pin hole to the arm up/down mechanism (plastic covered part) is about 10.53&#34;.<br />*Thule has these measurements on their website with drawings.  Please verify for yourself.<br /><br />-Some bikes may need a frame adapter (small bikes, women's frame, frames without a straight top tube) which is sold separately.<br />-The instructions are pretty good, especially if you've put one of these together previously.  We've done this 3 times now, so not hard.  There is not a lot of assembly but you do have to put the cradles on & figure out how to get it on your vehicle securely.  Leave yourself extra time the first time you do this & make sure to do it correctly.  After you've loaded & unloaded a couple times, it will be very easy & fast.<br />-Don't forget that your vehicle will now be &#34;longer&#34; with this rack on.  If you have a short garage/parking spot, your vehicle may not fit with the arms extended.  It is 39.38&#34; from center of the hitch pin hole to the end of the rack with arms extended.  So add that to your vehicle measurement.<br />-When the arms are down (no bikes) the rack extends 16.26&#34; from the center of the hitch pin hole.<br />-We bought a Thule Helium Rack more than 6 years ago & it still looks like new.  The rubber straps/cradles are all in perfect condition & the rack holds our bikes securely.  We bike a lot & use our racks often.<br /><br />Thule makes good quality racks.  And it's made in the USA!<br /><br />Hitch Lock:[[ASIN:B0002MBPDC Thule STL2 Snug-Tite Lock One Key System Locking Hitch Pin]]<br />Frame Adapter: [[ASIN:B004KZS5GW Thule Frame Adapter 982XT]]ou've put one of these together previously.

The Thule Glide 2 is an awesome stroller. We just recently purchased a BOB Duallie for the upcoming baby. However this new Glide 2 will give BOB a run for its money! Here's my breakdown...<br /><br />Positives:<br />1. Sleek design.<br />2. Very easy folding design.<br />3. Brakes! Very helpful on hilly trails.<br />4. Bottom cargo area can be closed, awesome!!!<br />5. Handle bar is adjustable and have a nice natural/ergonomic angle to it.<br />6. Magnetic viewing cover, better than Velcro in my opinion.<br />7. Fits perfectly though our front door.<br />8. Total length folded is about 6&#34; shorter than the BOB (37&#34; length) this is could be one of the biggest deal for us as our trunk space is not very large.<br />9. Easy to air fill tires.<br /><br />Negatives:<br />1. The Thule Urban Glide 2 you are unable to pull the stroller when folded unlike the Thule 1. The tire hits the frame when folded, this was probably done to lessen the total width of the stroller.<br />2. Handle bar is a bit too thin.<br />3. Parking brake is a little difficult to activate compared to BOB.<br />4. Thule Infant Car Seat Adapter might not work with the 2 model, unclear at this point because there's a bullet point on the description on Thule website &#34;Not to be used when second child in seat&#34;. Will update my review once I test purchase one.<br /><br />Overall, we are very impressed with the Thule Glide 2, this stroller is very easy to maneuver, the handbrake is an excellent feature at a lower price than the BOB Pro, fits through our doors perfectly, what else can you ask for?

Amazon gave us the opportunity to review Thule's new front mounted seat.<br /><br />I love front mounted seats because I enjoy being able to chat and interact with our children while riding. I also think that it is a safer ride for them because they are within my reach.<br /><br />First, I will say we have enjoyed the iBert and I hadn't noticed some of the \\\\\"issues\\\\\" it has until I compared it to Thule. They both weigh ~6lbs, so they don't really add weight to the bike and neither interfere with my knees.<br /><br />Installing the support bracket took me a little longer than I had anticipated to position on my bike because I had to remove my handlebar, but after a less than 30 min we were on our way. Once the bracket is installed removal and mounting of the seat is a breeze and takes only a few seconds (more about this in point 3).<br /><br />The details and engineering put into the design of the Thule definitely place it above the iBert.<br /><br />Vs the iBert the Thule<br /><br />1. Has a higher backrest.A low backrest is something that always bothered me about the iBert as I felt that it was difficult to ensure the shoulder straps remain in the correct position,<br /><br />2. Has adjustable footrests with straps for the child's feet. This is a game changer as our kids have always tried to put their feet up on my handle bar as we rode. I also appreciate that no matter how hard they try they will not be able to put their feet in the wheel.<br /><br />3. It is super easy to remove the seat once you mount it. This is the biggest reason I prefer the Thule to the iBert. The iBert has a slightly obnoxious pin that seems to be always stuck and difficult to remove. The thule seat has a small bracket with a lock. You use a key and  it takes literally a second to remove.<br /><br />4. A padded handlebar. The iBert has a plastic bar that goes across their thighs and is supposed to keep their hands occupied, but honestly it just makes it more difficult to load the child and they inevitably reach out to grab my handlebar. With the Thule seat this is no longer an issue.<br /><br />5. The Thule straps and buckles are stronger and more comfortable. The padding on the straps makes them more comfortable and the clasps are difficult for a child to undo and safer on the Thule. The only downside to this is that it is also more diffiult for me to undo the clips.<br /><br />6. The iBert has an extra 5lb weight limit that could be helpful if your children are large for their age like mine, but I don't think I could personally steer with a 38lb child front mounted anyway.<br /><br />The Thule has a higher price point, but in my mind just the ease of mounting the seat makes up for the extra cost.across their thighs and is supposed to keep their hands occupied, but honestly it just makes it more difficult to load the child and they inevitably reach out to grab my handlebar.

If that’s all you need, it’s really hard to do better than the Cadence.  However, it has no stroller utility at all, so even if you have an inkling that you might possibly have a need for a way to manage Junior at your destination…opt for the Coaster.  You cannot go back and add the stroller attachments to the Cadence later.  That said, this is a best-in-class bike trailer that is going to last long after your child outgrows it.  Very well built and handles like a dream.  Read on for the TLDR version…<br /><br />--<br /><br />In 2011 Thule decided to jump feet first into the child carrier market. This was heralded by the purchase of Chariot Carriers, a Canadian-based firm, and their offerings have been steadily expanding ever since. Since 2014 the line has been called “Active With Kids” and they aren’t kidding – these are products that are designed for active outdoor pursuits. Anything else would be a waste.<br /><br />As the line has been expanding, it has led to some at-times bewildering choices. Do I go for that shiny Chariot Cougar? What about a Cadence or Coaster? Thule has gone pretty much from zero to hero in this market, but it does take some deep thought to get the right product for you.<br /><br />Now, full disclosure – I’m a big fan of the Chariot line. These are the heftier multi-role child carriers. You can convert from a stroller to a bike trailer to a jogging stroller to a skiing carrier (yes, SKIING). And if you do a lot of outdoor stuff, this is probably your best bet. But lots of parents are more specialized…if all you do is jog, you don’t need a heavier trailer-type carrier. If you ride but don’t jog, a comparatively lighter trailer-only design will be much kinder to you when riding. And so on.<br /><br />So when you’re looking around, consider the Chariot options as the jack-of-all-trades, the one you seriously consider if you want/need multi-role support. But if you don’t need that flexibility and want something more dialed into your activities, then alternate options become a LOT more attractive.  And the Cadence is just such an item. It’s a dedicated bike trailer.  That is its mission in life, that’s what it is supposed to do, and it does it very well.  Much more svelte than the Chariot line (and somewhat lighter by about 8 lbs, which doesn’t sound like much until you’re pedaling it uphill…), it’s a more efficient option if it’s all you need or want.<br /><br />It is, however, important to note that if you have a child younger than six months, this is not going to work for you out of the box. There isn’t enough head support out of the box for an infant. No, you need to get the infant sling. However, keep in mind this is a smallish trailer and the Thule infant sling seems just a touch too long to fit in here comfortably. I had no issue with the infant sling in either the Cougar or Cheetah, so if you do have an infant this is something to consider. After discussing the issue with my pediatrician I felt comfortable using the infant sling on a smooth bike trail with my then three month old and had no issues at all. I did install the standard infant sling in this trailer and it fit acceptably well for me. Well, not for me, but for an infant. I'm too big...oh, never mind.<br /><br />This thing excels. It uses the EZ Hitch system, which I already had installed for my Cougar, and it installs very easily. I will say the EZ Hitch installs on the left side of the bike, so you are somewhat limited in making right hand turns…so plan ahead. It has a wide enough track where it’s nearly impossible to flip this thing over when attached and riding. And it isn’t like I didn’t try. Not with my kid in there, of course…no, her stuffed turtle George was the test pilot. And he came through OK.<br /><br />Construction is typical Thule – approaching but not quite crossing the line into overengineered. Your child is protected by an aluminum cage that is solid and sturdy. This trailer GLIDES though, which belies its heavy construction. This is important for a bike trailer, because you’re already towing a bunch of weight behind you (with all that implies vis a vis braking distance, turning radii, etc), so the last thing you need is a recalcitrant wheel. I have to say, between the excellent wheel design and the way it just glides around, rolling resistance seemed almost nil. Comfortable seating (which will not recline, so for infants you will need the infant sling) and a five point harness complete the safety part. There is a  little mesh storage bag inside the compartment for snacks and things.  Plenty of headroom for helmets as well.<br /><br />As the side panels do not open it can be a little awkward getting kids in and out. There is a very nice cargo compartment though (in fact, it's kind of like the trunk on a hatchback). The rear cover doubles as a sunshade, which is a neat design and very creative of Thule. There is enough flexibility in the design to keep Junior warm and dry or cool and comfortable, in that the cover has both clear plastic (for rain) and no-see-um mesh (for sunny days). In fact, when out for a ride definitely keep at least the mesh screen down...mud or rocks have a tendency to kick up behind any bike and you don't want Junior sprayed with gravel or anything.<br /><br />Now this is the time when parents start thinking &#34;well, what about the Coaster?&#34; As trailers, the two are identical (well, one is blue, one is green). The ONLY difference is that the Cadence CANNOT be turned into a stroller. At all. There is no way to attach a handlebar to the Cadence, the hitch arm doesn't retract, and so on. So here is your big decision point: If you think you'll need a stroller at your destination, even only suspect you MIGHT need one at some point....get the Coaster. Really. It's worth the comparatively minor premium to have that flexibility.  The weights are really about the same (maybe 1 lb difference if I’m being conservative), but the dimensions and the handling are identical.  Between the two, I’d have the Coaster.<br /><br />The materials on this trailer are outstanding - fabrics are sturdy and stitching is solid. This investment (and it is an investment...this thing is going to last long after Junior outgrows it) is a long term one.<br /><br />When not using, it folds up quite nicely, actually - and when you remove the wheels and the trailer hitch arm (all of which fit in the passenger compartment when folded up), you can get the entire shebang in the trunk of a Toyota Corolla sized vehicle.<br /><br />This is a fantastic trailer for parents who need a bike trailer and anything else would be a waste. It’s perfectly dialed into what a bike trailer should be, and again assuming you don’t want/need any stroller functionality…this is a very good choice.rdy.

The first thing to know before you start to love this thing as much as I do is that it’s not a stroller.  It’s a child carrier for a bike that TURNS INTO a stroller when you get where you’re going.  This is a fine line but it’s key.  That isn’t to say it’s a bad stroller (it isn’t), but it IS rather large (especially the two seater version - though not as large as a two seater Chariot I hasten to add) and is certainly not something you would use for a casual trip to the mall.  Not something you just toss into the trunk of your car to go shopping.  Not something you use to get Junior from the car to his airplane seat.  No, this is a bike trailer first, and it’s a very good one.  The stroller functionality exists for when you get where you’re riding and want an easy way to move Junior around once you get there.  That’s really it.<br /><br />It’s also important to note that if you have a child younger than six months, this is not going to work for you out of the box.

It's a ball-on-arm lever, so it seems like you use your hand, but it's way down low so your foot would be more convenient to use.  But it's awkward either way.  And the bike kit (included and installed) features a visibility flag, but there's no convenient place to keep the flag when you're using this as a stroller...so you feel kind of silly pushing this around with the flag attached.<br /><br />But those are nits.  This is a fantastic trailer for parents who need a bike trailer and a sometimes-stroller where anything else would be a waste.  If I'm being honest, I'll say the Chariot is the most flexible all around child carrier, but if you aren't going to be jogging in addition to riding...this is your best bet.Your child is protected by an aluminum cage that is solid and sturdy.

There is enough flexibility in the design to keep Junior warm and dry or cool and comfortable, in that the cover has both clear plastic (for rain) and no-see-um mesh (for sunny days).  In fact, when using this as a trailer, definitely keep at least the mesh screen down...mud or rocks have a tendency to kick up behind any bike and you don't want Junior sprayed with gravel or anything.  Now this is the time when parents start thinking &#34;well, what about the Cadence?&#34;  As trailers, the two are identical (well, one is blue, one is green).  The ONLY difference is that the Cadence CANNOT be turned into a stroller.  At all.  There is no way to attach a handlebar to the Cadence, the hitch arm doesn't retract, and so on.  So here is your big decision point:  If you think you'll need a stroller at your destination, evenonly suspect you MIGHT....get the Coaster.  Really.  It's worth the comparatively minor premium to have that flexibility.  The materials on this trailer are outstanding - fabrics are sturdy and stitching is solid.  This investment (and it is an investment...this thing is going to last long after Junior outgrows it) is a long term one.  When not using, it folds up quite nicely, actually - and when you remove the wheels, handlebar, and the trailer hitch arm (all of which fit in the passenger compartment when folded up), you can get the entire shebang in the trunk of a Toyota Corolla sized vehicle.  If i had nits, it would be the brake.  It's a ball-on-arm lever, so it seems like you use your hand, but it's way down low so your foot would be more convenient to use.  But it's awkward either way.  And the bike kit (included and installed) features a visibility flag, but there's no convenient place to keep the flag when you're using this as a stroller...so you feel kind of silly pushing this around with the flag attached.  But those are nits.  This is a fantastic trailer for parents who need a bike trailer and a sometimes-stroller where anything else would be a waste.  If I'm being honest, I'll say the Chariot is the most flexible all around child carrier, but if you aren't going to be jogging in addition to riding...this is your best bet.|2015-03-23 |\n",

With two major differences (hand brake, fixed front wheel) and one minor (no cover on the cargo carrier), it sacrifices flexibility for jogging comfort. If you already have a stroller you're happy with and need a dedicated sport stroller for jogging, this is your very best bet. If, on the other hand, you only have room for one stroller and need some flexibility in usage, the Urban Glide is the better option. Both are very light and feature best-in-class performance (indeed, I barely knew I was pushing the thing...) Read on for the TLDR review....<br /><br />--<br /><br />In 2011 Thule decided to jump feet first into the child carrier market. This was heralded by the purchase of Chariot Carriers, a Canadian-based firm, and their offerings have been steadily expanding ever since. Since 2014 the line has been called “Active With Kids” and they aren’t kidding – these are products that are designed for active outdoor pursuits. Anything else would be a waste.<br /><br />As the line has been expanding, it has led to some at-times bewildering choices. Do I go for that shiny Chariot Cougar? Am I compromising with a Glide? Thule has gone pretty much from zero to hero in this market, but it does take some deep thought to get the right product for you.<br /><br />Now, full disclosure – I’m a big fan of the Chariot line. These are the heftier multi-role child carriers. You can convert from a stroller to a bike trailer to a jogging stroller to a skiing carrier (yes, SKIING). And if you do a lot of outdoor stuff, this is probably your best bet. But lots of parents are more specialized…if all you do is jog, you don’t need a heavier trailer-type carrier. If you ride but don’t jog, a comparatively lighter trailer-only design will be much kinder to you on the bike. And so on.<br /><br />So when you’re looking around, consider the Chariot options as the jack-of-all-trades, the one you seriously consider if you want/need multi-role support. But if you don’t need that flexibility and want something more dialed into your activities, then this item becomes a LOT more attractive.<br /><br />The Glide (and the Urban Glide, which I'll be using as a comparison) is specifically dialed in for families who jog and for which anything more would be a waste. However, make no mistake - this is a BIG stroller. Though not heavy, the Glide series is not a casual &#34;hey, let's go to Starbucks&#34; stroller. It is somewhat clumsy in indoor settings, the Glide even moreso than the Urban Glide because of that fixed front wheel. But being an indoor stroller isn't the point of this, so no foul. The Glide series features a nice wide track, very good wheels that, well, glide. Really, it's nearly effortless to push. And if it starts to get out of control, there is a handbrake that works quite well out of the box. I didn't have to adjust it at all to get satisfactory performance out of it.<br /><br />Note these two items are in contrast to the Urban Glide. The Urban model is designed more for flexibility, as the (smaller) front wheel has a swivel feature to aid in maneuverability but will lock in place for jogging. The Glide is fixed-only. Therefore, your first question to yourself is if you'll be mostly jogging and sometimes strolling, or mainly strolling and sometimes jogging. I'd say even if you're going to, say, 30% stroll, opt for the Urban Glide, even though the Urban Glide has no handbrake.<br /><br />Another difference is in the folded dimensions - the Urban Glide folds more compactly than the Glide, owing to that swivel wheel. To get minimum folded dimensions here, you need to remove the back wheels AND the front wheel. The front wheel does feature a quick-release skewer to make this task easier, but it's still kind of a pain. Folded down and disassembled, it will fit in the back of a Toyota Corolla or equivalent, but only just. You really want a bigger car unless you want to keep taking that front wheel off.<br /><br />So, how well does it work? Like crazy. The rear suspension is dialed in enough to absorb bumps and keeps Junior comfortable. It feels almost like it's floating, if I'm being honest. The handlebar is adjustable and there's enough room so you don't keep hitting the stroller with your kick stride. In sum, you barely know it's there.<br /><br />The Glide has some decent storage, though not voluminous. It is mindful of the fact that what you put into it, you have to push, so cargo space is sized to keep you from going overboard. There's enough storage for some supplies for Junior, and that's enough. Remember - SPORT is the key concept here. You aren't taking this to the mall to load it up with shopping bags and coats. Other features shared are the reclining seat (near 90 degrees, actually), the sunshade design, five point harness (VERY nice), and overall construction (aluminum and high quality plastics with a fabric shell). Quite frankly, while some parents may look twice at the price, this really is an investment. As is the case with Thule in general, this item is going to be in fantastic condition well after Junior outgrows it. It's made THAT well.<br /><br />Now, the thing about the Thule line is they tend to be modular. You won't have a cupholder here unless you buy it separately. There is the standard Thule accessory bar so you can add a console kit (recommended) or cupholder. Thule has also released some Glide-only accessories, however I do NOT recommend the snack tray - it is made too long and too awkward to fit anyone but older (like 4-5 year old) kids.<br /><br />So to sum up this really long review (and thanks for reading this far down), if you are jogging ONLY and have no need for the comparatively larger multi-role carriers, and don't really need a stroller to take inside a store, this is your best bet. It's made to last a long time, it will stand up to the rigors of regular outdoor use, and it's comfortable for Junior. As a dedicated jogging stroller, this really has no peer. For a sometimes-jogging-sometimes-strolling family, the Urban Glide would be the better bet.la or equivalent, but only just.

I included a photograph with a regular package placed between the new vacuumed packed ones. The ingredients and sizes are similar, I hope they can keep the prices the same. Vacuum packed won't expand and pop at high elevations. I have had regular sealed foods pop, but never a mountain house but the highest I think I've been with packed foods is little over 1200ft.<br />What makes these so great is since the are freeze dried, they weight very little. That's important if you have to carry all your supplies on your back for multiple days.<br />Even regular camping they can come in handy if you make it back to camp late and it's raining or your just exhausted, then you just heat water are pour in package and minutes later a hot meal.<br />As far as taste they are pretty good. You could say they are high in salt but so is a can of soup.<br />If your hoofing it on the trail and sweating, your going to need that salt anyway.<br />With the egg meals there always seems to be a bit of water left over. I would rather have to much than not enough to allow the food to soak in and expand.<br />When your on the trail this food tastes fantastic, if you want to spice it up bring along some salsa packets or pepper flakes.<br />Nice thing about it also is clean cooking. With boiling water you can keep your pans clean just heat and pour into pouch. Hard to wash your dishes on trail without a water source or regulations are against it.<br />Even for people just trying to have an emergency stash of food in their homes that can be packed for quick evacuation these things can sit in the shelf for years. Current packing is good till 2026.<br />They also make larger packets for multiple servings, I can eat those by myself sometimes, hiking makes you so hungry.<br />They also make large cans that are

I've always been curious though.  It seems really convenient... especially for camping or for emergency use.  This seemed like a great opportunity to try it out.  I followed the directions to the letter and didn't deviate one bit.<br /><br />Preparation was easy, open bag, remove the oxygen absorber, add 1 cup boiling water and stir.  Reseal for 4 minutes.  Stir.  Seal an additional 5 minutes and eat.<br /><br />I could immediately smell breakfast when I added the water which I took as a good sign.  It smelled GOOD.  My mouth was actually watering.  Looks wise it was a little less appealing, kind of like a mushy casserole... but this is what you have to expect when it's all mixed together.  The taste was good too.  I think the smell might have been slightly better than the taste though.<br /><br />Consistency wise I had a few issues.  Some of the larger chunks of egg did not fully absorb the water so they were still hard in the middle and not pleasant to bite into.  Once I bit into one I could tell right away.  I avoided large chunks like that there were three in all.  You can't get a fork to cut them so they are pretty noticeable.  Also I found a piece of gristle in one of my small sausage chunks which was a little gross, but you get that with sausage that just goes with the territory there.<br /><br />I DEFINITELY would get these for camping though, they are super simple and if the rest of the meals have this quality of taste then I think they would be a hit with my family.  They would be way easier to pack and store and certainly much easier to make!!

NO COMPLAINTS!                                         |This item is awesome. It holds temp very well if you plan on traveling with it for a long period of time.<br /><br />Overall;<br />Design is awesome.<br />Handle is tight around the body (if you have big hands/knuckles touch/rub body while holding) Not a problem though.<br />Keeps temperature very very good.<br />Quick rinse and easy to put a sink brush to do minor scrubbing.<br />Wide spout for easy fill/pour<br />Able to unlock lid and pour with one hand. (May takes a couple attempts to get this technique down)<br />Lid locks very good/tight<br />Durable build<br />Government label is on the bottom. (See local growler fill rules/state laws)<br />NO COMPLAINTS ABOUT THIS GROWLER!!!<br /><br />Quick test Note: May not be 100% accurate but just to give anyone reading an idea.<br />I poured (5) 12oz beers and left growler out for a few hours at room temp not exposed to direct sunlight while I drank from it. Drink stayed as cold as when I first poured. I did leave some of the left over beer overnight to see how it held up in the growler and the only downside was that next morning I noticed the beer did start to go flat. I understand this would happen and I just wanted to see how it would hold up. Noting surprising but I personally would recommend no longer then 24 hours in a pinch but most probably drink five beers in that time anyways. After that beer starts to go flat. Recommended average time for a growler is max 36 hours.<br />This growler is highly recommend as it is easy to hold when filled, easy to pour, not designed to drink directly from the spout but you can.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |2015-08-31 |\n",

Tested it at home, boiled a cup of water in under 4min. It did take considerably longer to boil water while backpacking (5500'+ elevation) mostly the problem was the breeze though since in the morning (no breeze)it heated up water quite quickly. My 24oz stanley cup barely fit with the pot holder flipped in so I've made a small bracket to hold it. I've also made a windshield from a lightweight aluminum baking sheet so we'll see if that helps. Overall though very happy with this.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |2015-08-31 |\n",

I set main one to 170 psi Friday night Sat morning is at 140. So i didnt pay attention to it. That morning I loaded it again to 170psi and I took it for a ride, same result. Guys at the trail says &#34; you might have a leak and its not supposed to do that it supposed to hold air. One of them says dip it in water and see. So I did and found the problem. I posted &#34;DNM rear suspension leak&#34; on Youtube for you guys to see.

I weighed it on my own scale that I know to be accurate, and it is 128g.  This was a selling point for me, and although the tool has the features I want, I may have made a different decision had I known the actual weight.  Other than that, it seems to be a quality tool.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |2015-08-31 |\n",

I have been using wood walking sticks for tours around the neighborhood and shopping, but wanted something collapsible that I could stick in my purse and out of the way when I didn’t need to use it. (I’ve lost several wood walking sticks because I put them down to free my hands while shopping or eating, then forgot to retrieve them.)<br /><br />The EarthTrekGear Collapsible Adjustable pole is sturdy, easy to open and fold, and comes with a nice ripstop drawstring bag and a clear vinyl snap-top bag, either of which can be used for pole protection when carried or stored. Although the description says the pole folds to 12”, the user instructions tell you how to reduce the length another inch, so it can really be folded to 11”.<br /><br />See additional pictures not included for this listing with the description of the longer pole listing. The pole length is easily adjusted with a pushbutton. However, I’ve found on other devices with this type of length adjustment that the button breaks easily and can be accidentally pushed so the length adjusts unintentionally and is not reliable for holding a lot of weight. I wish I had noticed the pictures on the other listing before buying.<br /><br />The grip is rubber so gets sweaty. The grip is also smaller, shorter, and less comfortable to hold than my other trekking poles. I don’t know if the small grip size is standard for this brand pole or if they assumed that shorter people have smaller hands. I don’t. The wrist strap is too short to use – an extremely silly and unsatisfactory design/cost-cutting decision. Also, this pole is heavy at 12 oz., almost 50 percent heavier than other aluminum poles – a significant weight if you intend to use or carry it for long periods of time.<br /><br />In summary, I love the short collapsed size and ease of use. I will keep it in the car for short excursions, but continue looking for a lighter pole with a better fit for my longer treks and travel.<br /><br />Update – 10/31/2016<br />I ordered another one of these as a gift for a friend who liked my pole. They have changed the style slightly. The older pole I originally reviewed has an interesting rippled texture which I like (and you may still be able to see in the graphic of the folded pole); the newer version of the pole is smooth, as pictured in the graphic of the assembled pole. Although not as aesthetically interesting as the older pole, the newer version weighs only 10.5 oz. – a much more acceptable weight to carry. They have also increased the wrist strap to a useable length – yea! The grip is still sweaty, heavy rubber and too short for comfort on long walks, but add 1/2  star to my original review – someone is actually listening!ontinue looking for a lighter pole with a better fit for my longer treks and travel.<br /><br />Update – 10/31/2016<br />I ordered another one of these as a gift for a friend who liked my pole.

This is the first large house type air mattress i have purchased, although I have used camping type air mattresses over the years. I use it almost daily over the last month due to an injury that prevents me from sleeping in my regular bed. So far it has been very comfortable, and functions as described. The never flat pump works at least as well as expected. I do not hear it at night in a quiet house while sleeping on it. You can hear it self inflating if standing on that side of the bed, but it is much quieter than both the hum of our refrigerator and the air whistle coming out of the central air vents. While sleeping on the bed, i have never heard the pump start but it always stays inflated. if you have any experience with having to inflate your other air mattress every morning after use, you will truly appreciate this self-inflating feature.<br /><br />I purchased the headboard mattress, and although initially skeptical, i have to say it was worth it. it is a nice cushion to keep your pillows from falling off the bed, and not to mention it is a buffer against the wall if you flail your arms in that direction. the headboard is covered in the softer material like the rest of the top, so is comfortable to the touch. It fits queen size sheets exactly, but if you have a deep fitted sheet, it will not reach the bottom of the air mattress where the headboard is attached. This hasn't caused and issue, since the sheet seems to stay in place regardless.<br /><br />The innards seem rigid and there is not much movement overall, even when sharing the bed with another person. Caution, the warning instructions say not to pound or bounce on the bed. I've no idea what would happen if you pound or bounce the bed, but it may sounds dangerous.<br /><br />Overall this bed has been fantastic so far, and is the best one I have purchased to date. It seems very sturdy, and i hope it lasts awhile. I would purchase again if the need arises.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |2015-08-31 |\n",

It holds almost a quart which surprised me since it looks smaller.  I have yet to take it on a hike but I expect it will work well as it is light and strong.<br /><br />The major flaw in the design is that it wont hold the little fuel canister because the hole for the lid is too small.  My hope had  been that I could put the little etekcity stove and a fuel canister in there.  If OuterEQ had opened up the lid just an 1/4&#34; more it would have taken the fuel canister and probably the stove.  Oh well.  I'm otherwise happy with it and I'll stuff something else in there.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |2015-08-31 |\n",

I usually want to keep my camera and battery packs handy when backpacking but it can be a bit difficult digging through the lid or main compartment. The Ribz made everything easily accessible. It didn't intrude with my Stratos 50's fit and was easy to adjust around the torso.<br /><br />To be honest, I was a little skeptical of how useful this thing really was but once I used it as substitute for a light backpack I'm a true believer in this pack! When I setup camp, I left my Stratos 50 in my tent and only brought the Ribz and camera gear. I was even able to lug a Manfrotto tripod by hanging it across the Ribz. I managed to load the following in the Ribz:<br />- Sony a6000 w/ Rokinon 12mm lens<br />- Sony 18-200mm lens<br />- Sony camera battery (spare)<br />- Anker 12000mAh battery<br />- earphones<br />- 2 pairs micro USB cables<br />- lightning cable<br />- iPhone 6+<br />- small snacks<br />- car keys<br />- wallet                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |2015-08-31 |\n",

The tent is very lightweight and easy to carry. It's super simple to set up and take down. I'm 5'0 tall and was 130lbs. I could fully sit up with room above my head and plenty of room at my feet if I chose to put my pack at my feet inside.<br /><br />The ONLY complaint I have on it was the stakes. They're SUPER lightweight but shaped like an X on the top. When I had one on the rain flap Infront of the tent, I managed to kick it with my big toe. My toe still does not have feeling in the tip due to this. I immidiately ditched the stakes and replaced them with ones that were rounded on top which worked just as well. In their defense though, they were taken out of the hiker box within 5 minutes of being placed in there by another hiker looking to lessen their weight.<br /><br />I also wish it came with a compression bag. I tried shoving the tent in the stake bag only to tear a tiny hole at the seam. That's not the products fault though. Totally an impatient hikers fault.<br /><br />Worth buying. My 6 and 4 year old fit snugly but comfortably in here with me as well.<br /><br />Also, I made it 300 miles if you're wondering how long it will hold up.<br /><br />On a side note, I accidentally ordered two of these by mistake. I didn't return the &#34;extra&#34; until almost<br /> 1 1/2 months after purchase. It was out of the return time frame but since it wasn't opened or used, the company was very kind and allowed me to return it with only covering the $6 cost of shipping.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |2015-08-31 |\n",

                                                |I have been trying to make a good thin homemade pizzeria style pizza for quite some time but since my oven only gets up to 550 it was difficult to end up with a result that had the nice texture that a pizza can have when baked quickly at a high temperature.<br /><br /> We purchased the Camp Chef Italia Artisian Pizza Oven and used it on our gas grill;<br /> After some experimentation we found that if we removed the grates from the gas grill and set the pizza oven directly on top of the heat baffles we were able to reach much higher temperatures with both the surface temperature of the stone and the air temperature.<br /> We made several pizzas using the Roberta's &#34;Brooklyn style&#34; pizza dough recipe (Google it and you should find it quite easily if you wish) and got amazing results.<br /><br /> With a surface temperature of around 650 degrees and an air temperature of around 725 our pizzas were finished in about 5-8 minutes; The end result was about as close to a pizzeria style pizza as I can imagine I could ever expect to get at home.<br /><br /> For the low price of around $125 I am very happy with the Camp Chef Italia Artisian Pizza Oven and have no doubt that we will be getting a lot of use out of it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |2015-08-31 |\n",

I wanted a thermos without the glass interior (I'd broken several & it was more expensive to buy a replacement interior than to buy a new thermos - so I'd had enough of that)!<br /><br />2. I wanted a durable thermos for hunting, fishing, camping, or long trips.<br /><br />3. I especially wanted a wide-mouth thermos for chunky hot soup.(that's great for those early-season, cold-morning, fishing trips)!<br /><br />4. I wanted a thermos that was small enough to fit in my float tube pockets.<br /><br />This thermos fit the bill on all acounts and I've gotten plenty of great use from it, and it still looks new. Highly recommended!<br />Chris Gregory, Tekoa, WA                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |2015-08-31 |\n",

I camp quite a bit- anywhere from backpacking to canoe trips in the boundary waters and now with a couple kids, car camping as well.  We compared this tent to the Kelty Trail Ridge 6 and the Marmot Limestone 6.  This was as close as I could get to a perfect tent that matches the features we appreciate in our other tents, at a great price.  We used it for car camping last weekend, and loved it.  We couldn’t find an extensive review of this tent, so here is our experience:<br /><br />Unpacking:  Has its own stuff sack with printed instructions on the outside.  Easy to get the tent in and out.  There is a separate small bag for the tent stakes and a larger bag for the color-coded poles (3 poles for the tent, 1 for the rainfly).  Carrying bag has a nylon handle that I wish was connected to compression straps that could be cinched down to decrease the packed size, but I can purchase this separately.<br /><br />Setup:  Possible with one person.  The gold poles are threaded through a 2 inch nylon loop on the top middle of the tent- this isn’t immediately obvious and not covered on the instructions.  The ends of the poles clip into the grommets on the ground straps.  The rest of the tent clips onto the poles, which is great.  The rainfly is huge and difficult to get across the tent with just one person, but that isn’t surprising.  The rainfly straps are color coded and buckle into the ground straps, but you need to make sure that first you secure the Velcro straps, located underneath the rainfly, to each pole.<br /><br />Space:  Front vestibule is huge.  For car camping, throw a rug inside the vestibule, and it is a nice place to take off shoes and store gear or sit and watch the rain if you are so inclined.  The rear vestibule is big enough for shoes and a couple packs.  The tent is hexagon shaped inside.  I am 6 foot tall, and had plenty of headroom standing up.  We were able to fit a pack-n-play and 3 therm-a-rests side by side in the tent, with room to spare on all sides.  This is a 5+ person tent, and the first tent I have seen that doesn’t overestimate its capacity.  Just as you can fit 4 people in a 4 man tent if you are packed in like sardines, you could fit 6 in this if you had to (5 side by side from wall to wall, and one laying across at the rear door). However, this is a very roomy and comfortable tent for 4 people.  With the guy lines out, this tent took every bit of our 13X16 tent pad at the campsite.<br /><br />PROS:  -sturdy aluminum poles<br /> -7” aluminum J-stakes (hook stakes) are fairly light and strong (might purchase some MSR groundhog clones in the future)<br /> -doors have mesh windows and can be zipped up or down for airflow/privacy<br /> -quiet zippers with fabric pulls<br /> -under 15 lbs. weight, and actually fits in its carrying bag and is fairly compact<br /> -taped seams<br /> -5 mesh storage compartments sewn securely into walls (rather than a pocket that is hanging off the wall), “split” gear loft so you can thread your flashlight lantern through the gear loft and still use it for storage<br /> -3 roof vents for airflow<br /> -reflective guy lines<br /><br />CONS:  -Stitching is imperfect, lots of stray threads that give the appearance that the seams are unraveling (which I hope is not true)<br /> -Nylon ground straps and buckles feel insubstantial- hope they last<br /> -velcro straps that attach to rainfly seem flimsy and are poorly stitched<br /> -Rainfly- Biggest complaint for me that might not matter to other folks. I have seen other tents with large vestibules that have options for pitching it in a smaller configuration where you have space constraints.  Mountainsmith should have included some extra fabric loops and ties that would allow you to draw back the sides of the vestibule (not just the vestibule’s doors) to make a smaller space for tightercampsites.  Also, the rainfly must be secured with all guy lines so that it doesn’t slack or cling to the walls of the tent, which adds to the overall footprint, so factor that in when you are thinking about squeezing this tent into a smaller wooded campsite.<br /><br />In summary, this is a lot of tent for the price, with higher end features.  The tent fabric doesn’t feel cheap, the zippers are great, but the workmanship isn’t on par with higher end tents (which is the reason for 4 stars vs. 5).  However, most 5-6 person tents are set up for privacy and have solid paneled doors, such that when the rainfly is on, no one can see out or in, and there is no airflow.  This tent offers a great solution- you can zip up the windows in the doors when you need to change, even with the vestibule doors open, and have complete privacy.  When you want airflow, just unzip the windows in the doors and enjoy the air coming in through the mesh.|2015-08-31 |\n",

I'm a bit disappointed by this. Thankfully, I had some 550 cord in the house I substituted, but the tent should come as advertised. Thus the reason for three stars.<br />The set up was easy, tent seems well designed, the rain fly went on easily. There seemed to be enough room once I got inside. It came down and packed back into original packaging easily. The small nature and weight makes this attractive. I plan to use it in the field after airborne ops. I've been looking for something compact, lightweight, sturdy, and military in order to be allowed on field problems. This Raider seems to fit the bill. I'll be jumping this in two days and setting it up in the field.<br />Another reason for the three star review: the MMI sales rep kept bragging about this tent being &#34;under two pounds&#34; on my home scale it was 2.5 pounds. I know this may seem petty. Ounces are pounds as the saying goes. Just be truthful and advertise as under three pounds. Plus send what should come with it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |2015-08-31 |\n",

I've had Ex Officio boxers for years now and not a single pair shows any signs of use. However, the latest pairs I received (including this one) started pilling the very first time I wore them. Whatever quality change they've made to the fabric is very noticeable.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |2015-08-31 |\n",

He was thrilled and instantly hopped on it. He said it was very easy to turn and move. He stopped easily and said it was a very smooth ride. It says for kids and adults, but my size 11 feet didn't fit quite comfortably on there, nor would I put all my weight on it. I love the color options and this is a nice quality product. I'm not worried about him getting hurt in the local neighborhood with it. He packs it and brings it to the park and likes to show off and emulate the big kids.<br />I received this product at a discount in exchange for a review.

Teen 130lbs. 5'6.<br /><br />The vest sits well ( make sure you actually read how to fit it, and how it should sit for it to actually be effective)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |2015-08-31 |\n",

I've read about many people getting ripped off by paying too much, by the unit being defective in some way or taking entirely to long to arrive... I decided to order from Wallygadgets through Amazon and was not disappointed in anyway.. I ordered 2 and they both came with the bag, the chargers and a remote for locking the unit. They also came fully charged and ready to ride. It took only 9 days to arrive and that's even including a 2 day hold from customs. ALL these devices come from China and are relatively reasonably priced. In my opinion if you pay anything over 300.00 you're paying to much. As soon as they arrived we opened and started riding and riding and riding. It's been a few days and have had no battery issues. I even decided to give mine a charge just cause I didn't want it to be dead when I got ready to ride again although it didn't need it. I would suggest getting some sort of protection from scratches and scuffs because until you learn to master it, you will beat it up. We've banged it up pretty good and it hasn't skipped a beat. I plan on ordering a few more for my other adult kids and my wife cause it seems as though now she wants to ride. Big fun. Also get ready for a lot of people asking you about it. Highly recommend this retailer.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |2015-08-31 |\n",

This one is HANDS DOWN THE BEST BOTTLE I have ever used.  I am not the type to get enthusiastic about a water bottle but this one is different.<br /><br />BPA FREE - that is just huge! Why drink water if you are going to drink it from a contaminating source anyhow?<br />Large infuser basket - no more cramming teeny tiny slices of anything in it. This baby can hold - I used an entire spear of water melon in mine. Check out the photos!<br />Grips - Sweaty or wet hands? No worries, this one is ergonomically correct (or a right handed person that is) and has a nice molded grip.<br />Leak proof - the lid locks down  LOCKS DOWN! How awesome is that?<br />Flip top lid/ sipper lid - You do not have to worry about spilling. You have a sports bottle top.<br />Flip / hooking ring - You can attach this to your sport bag or hang it in your locker or even from your belt while hiking.  Its totally portable.<br />Light Weight but sturdy - this can drop yet survive the bounce.  Was not intentional but good to know.<br />Easy to clean - everything comes apart and is easy to get a standard bottle brush in there to wash it all out.<br />Multi-Style - the infuser basket it easy to remove and you are toting a large sports bottle.<br />Large capacity - this holds 32 ounces - that is a full quart - of water.  No more endless runs to the water fountain. More fruit water to go!<br /><br />The only thing I disliked? It took me forever to figure out the silver clip held the top from flipping up. I thought it was part of the styling and decor of the bottle.  Once I figured it out I felt a little foolish.  It is there to obviously prevent any spills.  That was the only thing I could say was a negative and even that is a positive.  This is simply the smartest designed infuser I have seen on the market. So glad I took a chance and bought this one. I will never go back to the other designs.<br /><br />I received this item at a reduced cost for the purpose of testing and evaluation.
